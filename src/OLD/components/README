# Text Search

## Text search v1
- uses property binding to populate necessary event values
- emits those values directly in the CustomEvent details with an additional field called "inputValue" that holds the actual value to query

## Text search v2
- uses the model "Search Event" to bind properties directly
- emits the SearchEvent object in the CustomEvent, with an additional field called "inputValue"

## Text search v3
- uses a combination of property binding and SearchEvent model
- accepts property bindings like in v1, but then assigns those values to a SearchEvent type that is placed in the details of the CustomEvent. 
- the input data is passed as a separate field in the details of CustomEvent

## Thoughts
- I think v3 is the cleanest solutions because: 

1. Property binding is clear
2. Don't have to extra checking for context and condition to see if they were binded correctly
